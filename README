Midpoint Review: Final Project
A. Samuel Pottinger

Build instructions:
--
$ make final
$ ./final


Controls:
--
 * Mouse changes viewing angle.
 * P pauses the spinning light.
 * W increases the altitude of the light.
 * S decreases the altitude of the light.
 * d decreases the seperation force in the boyds simulation
 * D increases the seperation force in the boyds simulation
 * a decreases the alignment force in the boyds simulation
 * A increases the alignment force in the boyds simulation
 * c decreases the cohesion force in the boyds simulation
 * C increases the cohesion force in the boyds simulation


Resources:

I found the given ground texture at http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~zwood/

Left to do:
--
 * I have dynamic recalculation of normals and subtle flapping for the birds but
   I want to make the motion more pronounced.
 * I have a vector indicating where the bird is going but I need it to face that
   direction.
 * The hot air balloons should disrupt the birds.
 * The 3rd person view from a hot air balloon. This should provide a better look
   at birds.
 * A better lit environment. Perhaps softer wings with radial lighting / 
   normals.


Stretch goals:
--
 * Larger scene
 * Some terrain objects (a few scattered trees)
 * Procedurally generated terrain
 * Maybe skybox
